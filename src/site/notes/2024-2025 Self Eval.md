# Failures

- **UCSC Gutenberg Blocks Plugin**
	- The Gutenberg Blocks plugin includes blocks for the _Campus Directory, Class Schedule, Course Catalog_, and the deprecated _Accordion and Accordion Wrapper_ blocks.
	-  In an attempt to clean up and organize the code, I missed the build step (more accurately, I did not realize Kumar had previously shipped the code "built," i.e., he included the `build` directory).
	- I also did not have a proper testing regimen in place so what I thought tested "good" was, in fact, not good at all.
	- This resulted in the above mentioned blocks being unavailable for Campus users for approximately **one week**.
- **Lessons learned**
	- **TESTING** As a result of this failure, I re-vamped my local development environment and established a better testing process.
	- **DON'T BITE OFF MORE THAN I CAN CHEW** The work I did in the GB plugin was done over several months and had *way  too large a scope*. I learned to take issues in smaller bites (bytes? üòÉ) and to properly scope the intended changes prior to doing the work.
