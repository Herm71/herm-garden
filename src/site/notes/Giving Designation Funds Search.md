## Understanding of the Project
University Advancement, Alumni Giving has an existing [Alumni Giving Designation Search](https://designationsearch.ucsc.edu/search-designations/index.php) tool, which is a custom PHP script. The [[Giving Site Migration\|Giving Site Migration]] to WordPress is underway and this functionality will be incorporated into the new site. This data exists in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v4mE2ffp2JCcmtBz4rYCke_ZX-y15Rok/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103689770236599533068&rtpof=true&sd=true) and will need to be imported.
## Approach
The approach to this Project is to utilize **Advanced Custom Fields** to create a *Custom Post Type* with *Custom Fields* that will contain the designation search tool data. Users will be able to search the Funds database based on the data in these custom fields.

A custom WordPress template or page will be used to display the listings. Custom search functionality will be implemented that users can filter and search by the custom fields.
## Constraints
The new Giving site will be on our CampusPress network, which restricts our ability to create a custom plugin; therefore, as much functionality as possible needs to be done within the interface of the WordPress Dashboard.
