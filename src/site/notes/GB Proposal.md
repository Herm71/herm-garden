The [C&M Web Team](https://advancement.ucsc.edu/about/the-team/communications-and-marketing/#:~:text=ngonza32%40ucsc.edu-,Digital%20Strategies,-Robert%20Allen%20Knight) has developed a decent workflow on [Github](https://github.com/) with respect to creating issues, issuing PRs, reviewing and approving PRs, and issuing releases. We have implemented build and release hooks that automatically issue a release and generate a change log and release notes for our projects. This workflow is not currently incorporated into the Gutenberg Blocks repo.

With Kumar needing to divide his attention between two teams, and Bryn and the ITS Team being busy with WCMS issues, the [UCSC Gutenberg Blocks](https://github.com/ucsc/ucsc-gutenberg-blocks) plugin has fallen behind in terms of addressing Issues and Pull Requests, and issuing timely releases. Considering the age of the existing [Issues](https://github.com/ucsc/ucsc-gutenberg-blocks/issues) and [Pull requests](https://github.com/ucsc/ucsc-gutenberg-blocks/pulls) in the repository, the GB plugin appears to be in "maintenance mode."

The C&M Web Team is currently managing a [third-party contractor](https://tri.be/) who is tasked with updating the **Directory Block** part of the GB plugin. Once they come online, they will be submitting commits and PRs to the GB Repo. 

Since there will soon be active development on this plugin, we would like to propose that the **C&M Web Team** be added as (Super?) Admins to this repo. That way, we can incorporate our current workflow into the GB plugin development, and we'd be responsible for issuing releases, creating release notes and communicating with CampusPress.Â We can assign issues to Kumar or Corinne or whomever if they're outside of our wheelhouse.
