I've loved organization and project management systems since I was a kid. In high school, I had a [Franklin Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FranklinCovey) personal organizer (amazingly, [they still exist](https://store.franklinplanner.com/)!). In the 90s, I had several versions of the [PalmPilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot). In the early aughts, I discovered Paul Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) (GTD) system and devoted both my professional and personal life to it. 

These days, I'm a web developer in the [communications and marketing](https://communications.ucsc.edu/) department of a [major research university](https://www.ucsc.edu/). In recent years, I've used [Trello](https://trello.com), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Asana](https://www.notion.so/) to manage projects and keep track of tasks. 

Recently, a work colleague suggested that I try [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). He recommended it to me on a Friday with a warning, "this will take over your entire weekend." He wasn't wrong! 

I've been using/exploring/learning Obsidian for three or four months. TLDR: This thing is awesome.

As a developer, I am a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) enthusiast. I've developed several static sites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) so I'm comfortable using front matter. Obsidian combines the ease of writing that comes with Markdown with the power of tags and properties in the front matter (as well as inline), along with a robust plugin community, to create a seriously powerful organizational tool. 

There are a Zillion posts on the internet describing methodologies for "getting things done" using Obsidian: ways to organize your file structure, ways to tag your notes, ways to query notes based on tags, task management, etc. Here are some methodologies I'm exploring as I fine-tune my Vault:

- **Flat file structure:** I'm currently working with a flat file structure, employing the [Maps of Content](https://obsidian.rocks/maps-of-content-effortless-organization-for-notes/) concept, which relies on backlinks to files to keep your vault in order
- **Git plugin:** I created a private Git repo for my vault. The Obsidian [Git plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here) allows automatic syncing of my local vault with my private repo
- **Digital Garden plugin:** I'm intrigued by the concept of a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). The Obsidian [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) is an easy way to create one. In short, the Digital Garden plugin allows you to easily publish notes in your vault to a service like Netlify. Even if you don't use it for a "Digital Garden," per se, it enables push-button publishing of your notes, allowing one to convert their vault into a website.
