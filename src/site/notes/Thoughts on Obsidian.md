>[!tldr] TLDR:
> As a web developer, I am a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) enthusiast. I've developed several static sites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and am comfortable using frontmatter. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) combines the ease of writing Markdown with the power of frontmatter (and inline) tags and properties. Add to that  a robust plugin community you've got a seriously powerful project and task management tool

I've loved organization and project management systems since I was a kid. In high school, I had a [Franklin Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FranklinCovey) personal organizer (amazingly, [they still exist](https://store.franklinplanner.com/)!). In the 90s, I had several versions of the [PalmPilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot). In the early aughts, I discovered Paul Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) (GTD) system and devoted both my professional and personal life to it.

These days, I'm a web developer at a [major research university](https://www.ucsc.edu/). In recent years, I've used [Trello](https://trello.com), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Asana](https://www.notion.so/) to manage projects and keep track of tasks. 

Recently, a work colleague suggested that I try [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). He recommended it to me on a Friday with a warning: "this will take over your entire weekend." He wasn't wrong.

There are a Zillion posts on the internet describing methodologies for "getting things done" using Obsidian: [ways to organize your files](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-do-i-structure-notes-effectively-in-obsidian/49734) (using folders? flat?), ways to [tag your notes](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-guide-on-links-vs-tags-in-obsidian/28231), ways to [query notes](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/), [task management](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction), etc. While I haven't explored them all, I've read enough to start formulating my own workflow.

As I've been using/exploring/learning Obsidian for three or four months, here are some methodologies I'm exploring, including associated plugins:

- **Flat file structure:** I'm currently working with a flat file structure, employing the [[Maps of Content\|Maps of Content]] concept, which relies on backlinks to files to keep your vault in order
- **Git plugin:** I created a private Git repo for my vault. The Obsidian [Git plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here) allows automatic syncing of my local vault with my private repo
- **Digital Garden plugin:** I'm intrigued by the concept of a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). The Obsidian [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) is an easy way to create one. In short, the Digital Garden plugin allows you to easily publish notes in your vault to a service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Even if you don't use it for a "Digital Garden," per se, it enables push-button publishing of your notes, allowing one to convert their vault into a website.
- **Tasks:** Using the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin, it is easy to aggregate tasks across Obsidian notes, allowing me to see all my to-dos in a single note.
- **Dataview plugin:** The [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin enables you to "treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from." Use it for:
	- Creating charts
	- Creating tables
	- Creating lists
