Welcome to my [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). This is my attempt at organizing my thoughts and sharing them to the web. This  is a work in progress, as I am still learning the contours of this new concept. 

I am currently using this space to share notes with colleagues, reference items for easy access, and nascent thoughts that may one day become a full post. 

These notes are first drafted in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
