### Notes from Open Labs
In today's open labs Adam was demoing an SEO plugin. One of the options it provided was to `no-index` a page or post. I think it was rhetorically asked, "why would you want to do that?". I came up with a use case as to why we might want to do this. We might want to share with our users.
#### Why use `no-index` on a Published page? 
Although WordPress allows saving drafts in the editor, it's not easy to share "draft" content without publishing it. Content creators often need to share pages with others for review. Sharing a published post or page is the easiest way to do this. 

As users build their site on the network, it's `no-index`ed globally. But once we launch, the entire site begins to be indexed. 

Using the `no-index` option on a page or post allows an editor to publish content and share it among colleagues for review without The Google picking up crumby content. Once the edits are complete this option can be de-selected and Big G is free to index the beautifully crafted prose.

Sorry I have not gotten back to you on this Adrienne. I did go into your site and added alt text to all the images, so that problem should be fixed.

Few notes:

- My recommendation is to focus on the broken links that are referenced at the bottom of the page.Â 
- The comment about text too long is accurate but I understand this is political so I think you could look over if for now but it is true there is a ton of copy. If you have some funds, a good copy editor could problably help a lot. Miranda can give you a freelancers name. She is in our system
- The contrast on the image on blue is something I struggle with. HOW bad is this for screen readers? We do it in the home environmentâ€¦.
