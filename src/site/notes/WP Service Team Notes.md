Sorry I have not gotten back to you on this Adrienne. I did go into your site and added alt text to all the images, so that problem should be fixed.

Few notes:

- My recommendation is to focus on the broken links that are referenced at the bottom of the page.Â 
- The comment about text too long is accurate but I understand this is political so I think you could look over if for now but it is true there is a ton of copy. If you have some funds, a good copy editor could problably help a lot. Miranda can give you a freelancers name. She is in our system
- The contrast on the image on blue is something I struggle with. HOW bad is this for screen readers? We do it in the home environmentâ€¦.
